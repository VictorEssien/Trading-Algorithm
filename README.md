# Trading-Algorithm
This was a project to download an ETF with a minimum of 100 assets, retrieve historical data for at least the past 5 years and use Berry Cox's price momentum factors to calculate the monthly z-factor score for each asset. It also creates long and short baskets using calculated z-factors and backtests to validate performance of your algorithm.
