# Trading-Algorithm
This was a project to download an ETF with a minimum of 100 assets, retrieve historical data for at least the past 5 years of your chosen ETF and use the price momentum factors to calculate the monthly z-factor score for each asset Identify long and short baskets (10 to 15 assets in each) using calculated z-factors Step 6: Create a backtest to validate performance of your algorithm based on monthly restructuring over the  previous 5 years. Step 7: Chart: 1. Monthly portfolio return bar chart (pos/neg coloring) vs ETF 2. Monthly return for long picks vs short picks vs ETF 3. Cumulative portfolio return vs ETF
